## Overview
The Traffic Light State Diagram illustrates the behavior and transitions between the different states of a traffic light system. This model helps to visualize how a traffic light operates to control the flow of traffic at intersections by transitioning through specific states such as green, yellow, and red.

## Purpose
The purpose of this diagram is to:
- Provide a clear understanding of the state transitions for a typical traffic light.
- Serve as a reference for designing or simulating traffic control systems.
- Assist in implementing the logic for embedded systems controlling traffic signals.

## State Descriptions
1. *Green Light*:
   - *Description*: The light is green, allowing vehicles to proceed through the intersection.
   - *Duration*: Typically lasts 30-60 seconds, depending on traffic conditions.
   - *Transition*: Switches to the yellow light to indicate an upcoming stop.

2. *Yellow Light*:
   - *Description*: The light turns yellow to warn that the green phase is ending and a red phase will follow.
   - *Duration*: Typically lasts 3-5 seconds.
   - *Transition*: Changes to the red light to stop traffic.

3. *Red Light*:
   - *Description*: The light is red, requiring all vehicles to stop.
   - *Duration*: Typically lasts 30-60 seconds, depending on traffic conditions and pedestrian crossings.
   - *Transition*: Switches to the green light to allow traffic to move again.

## State Transitions
- *Green to Yellow*: Indicates the end of the go phase and prepares drivers to stop.
- *Yellow to Red*: Signals a complete stop for vehicles.
- *Red to Green*: Resumes traffic flow, allowing vehicles to proceed.

## Diagram Overview
The state diagram includes three main states:

- *Green* ➔ *Yellow* ➔ *Red* ➔ *Green* (repeats)

Each state transition is governed by a set duration and traffic control logic that may include sensors or timers.

## Usage
- *Engineering Projects*: Use the diagram as a base for coding traffic control systems.
- *Simulation Tools*: Import the diagram into traffic simulation software to test scenarios.
- *Educational Purposes*: Teach concepts of finite state machines and control systems.

## Example Implementation
A simple pseudocode example:
pseudo
state = GREEN

while true:
    if state == GREEN:
        wait(30 seconds)
        state = YELLOW
    else if state == YELLOW:
        wait(5 seconds)
        state = RED
    else if state == RED:
        wait(30 seconds)
        state = GREEN


## Conclusion
Understanding the traffic light state diagram is essential for building traffic control mechanisms that improve road safety and traffic flow. The states and their transitions provide a straightforward model for developers and engineers to create reliable systems.
